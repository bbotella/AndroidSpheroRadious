AndroidSpheroRadious
====================

First of all, just to say that I have used this project as a Hello World application to begin developments unisg this great tool from Orbotix, Sphero.

The Android App allows you to control the Sphero and play with it, and changes the ball color depending on how far it is from you. From green when it's close, to red when it is far and there is risk of losing the Bluetooth connection.


Usage
-----

Import the project in Eclipse (I used last version of ADT bundle) and compile it.



Next Steps
----------

- Improve interface.
- Delete color button and color picker view.
- Change its logo.
- Test with different screen sizes.
- Upload the app to Google Play.
